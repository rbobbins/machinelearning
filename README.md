Geoff and I are doing a four credit self-study in Machine Learning this semester at Olin College. This repo includes the work we've collaborated on.

During phase 1 of the self-study, we followed Andrew Ng's ML course on Coursera. While this was going on, we were applying the techniques we learned to the Kaggle competition at http://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer. The goal of this competition is for budding data scientists to create algorithms that could accurately recognize handwritten digits. We worked on four different algorithms, listed below:

* Linear classifier
* Logistic classifier
* Neural networks
* K-nearest neighbor
